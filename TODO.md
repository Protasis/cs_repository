# TODO
The following are todos for which a basic infrastructure of the code/models
already exists and some logic is missing:
  + parse advisory ids and create url
  + handle write permissions to modify articles
  + parse automatically PublicationBase model to export bibtex if the bibtex hasn't been inserted manually (and convert automatically to other formats XML/RIS...)
  + parse automatically bibtext (i.e. bibtexparse) to add a paper
  + add check on read for GroupAccess ''accessible'' operations 

Other features that can be added in the future include:
  + user comments
  + statistics for projects/papers/authors
  + better management system for permissions/insertions
