# Protasis CollabTool
The Protasis CollabTool is based on django and composed of several modules:

  * admin module to insert projects, papers, and code (or references to them)
  * display pages to show the content of the db
  * wiki to insert more structured material for a given project (i.e. teaching material)


Limitations/Future works:
   * It's not possible to have a single wiki root for each project (https://github.com/django-wiki/django-wiki/issues/63)
   * It could be integrated with owncloud, and eventually gitlab to help keep code and data better organized.
